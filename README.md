Data Science Portfolio
This repository demonstrates my proficiency in Python for data science, including data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. The project analyzes the Iris dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a classification model.
Project Structure

data/iris.csv: The Iris dataset used for analysis.
src/eda.py: Python script for exploratory data analysis.
src/model.py: Python script for training a machine learning model.
notebooks/iris_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis and visualizations.
requirements.txt: Dependencies for the project.
README.md: This file, explaining the project.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, classified into three species.
Usage

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-portfolio.git
cd data-science-portfolio


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the EDA script:python src/eda.py


Run the model training script:python src/model.py


Explore the Jupyter notebook:jupyter notebook notebooks/iris_analysis.ipynb



Project Details

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations (e.g., pair plots, histograms).
Machine Learning: Implements a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn to predict iris species.
Notebook: The Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis, including code, visualizations, and explanations.

Dependencies
See requirements.txt for the full list of Python packages used.
